# README

I played with the Twitter API : I collected data about likes french députés give to each others. I created a network graph using gephi. The colors correspond to their political groups in the Assembly (that are differents from their actual politic party). I got information on this website : https://www.nosdeputes.fr/

I have collected only the 199 last likes of each account. I haven't found the account of 40 députés (on 585).
