#API keys

The credentials for the API are in a file named auth.py, stocked at the root of the repository and with this syntax :

```{python}
CONSUMER_KEY = '<your key>'
CONSUMER_SECRET = '<your key>'
ACCESS_TOKEN = ''<your key>''
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = '<your key>'
```

#Data folder
I chose to not git the data I collected to build the graph.
